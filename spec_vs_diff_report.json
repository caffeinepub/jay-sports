  "summary": "The diff shows that frontend/index.html has been updated with all domain references correctly pointing to 'https://www.jaysports.in' (canonical, og:url, og:image, twitter:url). The Google Analytics config does not reference the old domain. The frontend-file-summaries.txt also confirms these changes. REQ-1 appears to be satisfied for the HTML file. However, the diff does not provide evidence of a scan/update of TSX/TS component files for hardcoded domain strings, and the frontend-file-summaries.txt summary note ambiguously states 'No files were modified — all domain references were already correctly set to https://jaysports.in in the previous version,' which may mean no TS/TSX files contained the old domain or that they were not checked.",
